Apart from that, distance variable also having great influence onto the log price variables. It shows us that as one house is getting close to the city, the log price is higher. For comparison among house type, it shows that type_u is having a higher coefficient value compare to other type. By analyzing the relationship, it tells us that unit house type is more cheaper than other house type. On the hand, if we compare among the region, it can clearly be seen that coefficient value of southern metropolitan is ahead of other region and since the relationship is positive, it means that the
