In this project, I have utilized the NFC function to create a business card that holds the website link to the card owner's business profile webpage whereby the webpage is highly customizable by the owner, and all the changes are immediately reflected on the webpage. At any time when the card owner wish to share their profile with their friend, he may just present his card to other and let others tap their phone on the business card, a link will then pop out and the browser will open up the page
